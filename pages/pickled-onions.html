    <!-- Here put description of dish  -->
    <p>
      Pickled onions are one of the greatest, if not the absolute greatest
      topping ever (in my humble opinion) I am yet to find a dish to which you
      cannot add them, or eat them as side dish. In both ways they manage to
      absolutely enhance the flavour, and their acidity is always appreciated as
      a counterbalance , or just to kick you salivary glands into overdrive!
